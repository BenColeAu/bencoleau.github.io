I work in IT across service delivery, endpoint management, and technical support. My experience in the local government sector spans day-to-day support, Intune and Configuration Manager administration, PowerShell automation, and occasional server management. I focus on ensuring IT systems are reliable, efficient, and well-maintained, streamlining processes and improving operational consistency.

In addition to Windows, I manage iOS and Android devices through Intune, maintaining consistent configuration and security across mixed device environments. This site provides scripts, notes, and practical insights drawn from real-world IT operations that may be useful to other professionals.
